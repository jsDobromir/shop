ingredient

NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3)
Our favorite ingredient at Olay is Vitamin B3. This ingredient is known to help skin retain moisture keeping it seriously hydrated. Vitamin B3 can also hydrate to help with surface skin cell turnover and regeneration, as well as exfoliation to remove dull skin. Long story short - it's our unicorn.

VITAMIN B5
This ingredient effectively penetrates skin and moisturizes from within. It improves your skin barrier to help defend from DNA-damaging toxins and pollution.

AMINO PEPTIDE
Amino Peptides are chains of amino acids and the building blocks of skin cells. These "boss babe" molecules are known to help skin look smoother and firmer.
