ingredients

VITAMIN C
Vitamin C is a naturally-occurring antioxidant that is known to fight free radicals on skin surface and ultimately protect your skin from visible damage that you see in the mirror as fine lines and uneven skin tone. This ingredient is also known to help brighten your skin and fortify its surface moisture barrier. Think of it as a healthy citrus kiss for your skin.

AMINO PEPTIDE
Amino Peptides are chains of amino acids and the building blocks of skin cells. These â€œboss babeâ€ molecules are known to help skin look smoother and firmer.

NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3)
Our favorite ingredient at Olay is Vitamin B3. This ingredient is known to help skin retain moisture keeping it seriously hydrated. Vitamin B3 can also hydrate to help with surface skin cell turnover and regeneration, as well as exfoliation to remove dull skin. Long story short â€“ itâ€™s our unicorn.
