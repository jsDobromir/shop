COLLAGEN PEPTIDE
This peptide acts in the same way that naturally occurring peptides work in younger skin. So as your skin ages, applying this topical peptide supports your skin's natural renewal processes, so skin appearance is noticeably improved.

NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3)
Our favorite ingredient at Olay is Vitamin B3. This ingredient is known to help skin retain moisture keeping it seriously hydrated. Vitamin B3 can also hydrate to help with surface skin cell turnover and regeneration, as well as exfoliation to remove dull skin. Long story short, it's our unicorn.
